# Productivity App


This project stems from the idea of creating a multipurpose app that aligns with my current workflow: 

- Note-taking. 
- Formalizing notes into tasks.
- Executing tasks through sessions using the Pomodoro technique. 

This portfolio project is a work in progress. While it currently includes all the necessary features (Pomodoro timer, task management, and note-taking), the following are slated to be added in future updates: 

- Calendar. 
- Color and style customization.
- Support for multiple languages.
- Creation of subtasks. 

And more!

Feel free to take this project as a template or enhance existing functionalities.
